= Maven 4 install issue

Install fails when using mirrors and profile activation using bare negation of a `<property><name>` when the parent is not available in the mirror

== Start a repository manager

Use some kind of repository manager.
Everything is currently configured to use https://reposilite.com/guide/about[Reposilite] listening on port 8080 as a repository manager.

It can be brought up with `docker compose up` using the provided _compose.yaml_ file.

== Deploy the parent pom

We'll do the install to a local maven repo so the artifact won't be available to the dependent-project later.
